## Overview

This project focuses on building a realistic and animated 3D model of a football terrain using Blender. The work includes:

- Modeling the entire field based on **FIFA standards**
- Designing and animating surrounding elements like chairs, stadium structure, and lighting poles
- Using **materials**, **modifiers**, and **particle systems** for realism
- Creating a short **animation** to showcase the scene

## Features

### Football Field
- Created from a resized plane with accurate **FIFA dimensions**
- Grass generated using Blender's **Particle System (Hair)**
- White lines drawn with **Bezier Curves**
- Running track made using **curved planes** and proper line markings
  

### Goal Posts & Corner Flags
- Goals from **cubes**, net made with **Wireframe Modifier**
- Corner flags modeled from **cylinders** and **triangular planes**


### Light Poles
- Cylindrical base shaped with **Edge Slide**
- Top panels created using **Boolean operations** and **Array Modifier**
- Light boxes formed using scaled cubes

### Stadium Chairs
- Modeled from basic cubes
- Smoothed using **Subdivision Surface Modifier** and **Bevel**
- Colored with different materials: blue, green, and orange
